# Roy_Floyd_Project

The aim of this project is to implement the Roy-Warshall-Floyd algorithm which
determines the minimum cost path between all nodes in a graph. The algorithm will be implemented in
both Java and C ++ languages using different techniques.
Therefore, I will implement a sequential and a parallel variant with
threads in Java and two parallel versions in C ++ using MPI and
STL. At the end I will compare the results obtained in each case, on the same data set offered as input.

* Sequential Java
* Parallel Java
* Parallel C++ with MPI
* Parallel C++ with STL
